0. From **abstract**: Fine tune classification task pre-trained CNN(AlexNet or VGG) for image retrieval with hard positive and hard negative examples learned from **3D reconstruction task**.

    <span class="evidence">*Question*</span>: Why can reconstruction task provide clue for hard negative/positive example? How about choosing verification task or recognition task?


1. Compare *Triplet Loss* and *Contrastive Loss*:
    - In this paper the author chose *contrastive loss* because **generalize better and to converge at higher performance**
    - Triplet Loss:
    
        $$
        L = \sum_i^N(||f(x^a)-f(x^p)||_2^2 - ||f(x^a)-f(x^n)||^2_2)
        $$
    - Constrastive Loss:
    
        $$
        L(i,j) = \frac{1}{2}(Y(i,j)||\overline{f}(i)-\overline{f}(j)||^2)+(1-Y(i,j))(\max\{0, \tau-||\overline{f}(i)-\overline{f}(j)||^2\})
        $$

        $\tau$ is able to exlude the influence of example when non-matching pairs have large enough distance.

    - >The triplet loss appears to be inferior in our context; we observe oscillation of the error in the validation set from early epochs, which implies over-fitting.

2. > For a query image *q*, a pool *M(q)* of candidate **positive** images is constructed based on the camera positions in the cluster of *q*. It consists of the *k* images with closest camera centers to the query.
    
    To further sample postive example, three strategies are come up with in the paper:

    - MAC distance: choose the image with the lowest MAC distance to the query. (MAC distance means inner product between **L2 normalized ReLU** activation of two image representation)
    - maximum inliers: choose the image with the highest number of co-observed 3D points with the query.
    - relaxed inliers:
        - change the candidate positive set to **all images** with **enough** number of co-observd 3D points with the query, but not with too extreme scale change
        - select **randomly** from the candidate set
        - help to increase the variance of viewpoints.
